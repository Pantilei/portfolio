          <p>
            Most of my career I was doing engineering. Recently I realized that
            programming is what makes me happy, it is my passion. Even in my
            engineering path, when making calculations, I was using programming
            languages, sometimes Excel and Visual Basic to develop macros for
            certain tasks, sometimes MatLab. One thing that played huge role in
            taking the decision to become a programmer was Python language. I
            used it once to write a script for my Master thesis and I fellt in-+
            love with it. Later on, I decided to learn it. I got familiar with
            its very powerful framework Django for building web applications,
            but I realized that in order to build a powerful web application
            with responsive and beautiful UI/UX I need to learn HTML5, CSS and
            JavaScript, and I made it. I learned all of these technologies and
            moreover their most famous frameworks, such as REACT JS, Bootstrap
            and Sass. And this is not the end, I am still working on these
            skills to master them.
